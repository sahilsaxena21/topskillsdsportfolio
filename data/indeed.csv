Neo4j is the leader in graph database technology. As the world’s most widely deployed graph database, we help global brands – including Comcast, NASA, UBS and Volvo – to reveal and predict how people, processes and systems are interrelated. Using this relationships-first approach, applications built using Neo4j tackle connected data challenges such as analytics and artificial intelligence, fraud detection, real-time recommendations and knowledge graphs. Find out more at neo4j.com.

Our Vision:

At Neo4j we have always strived to help the world make sense of data.

As business, society and knowledge become increasingly connected, our technology promotes innovation by helping organizations to find and understand data relationships between people, processes, locations and systems. We created, drive and are at the forefront of innovation in the Graph Database category; and we’re disrupting how organizations leverage their data to innovate and stay competitive.

Graph databases have grown over 1000% in the last ten years. The use of graphs in data science has also seen a strong adoption and growing interest. The problem is, there’s still a large portion of the data science community who is unfamiliar with when, why, and how to use graphs in their data science solutions. This person would be tackling this problem.

Neo4j is the world’s leading graph database in the world and the Developer Relations team wants to find someone to help build awareness, knowledge, and understanding around graph data science to the overall data science community.

This role will involve educating data scientists about the new opportunities, creating compelling content, and examples for data scientists who want to get started with the tools and techniques of a graph database.

A fan of collaboration, especially with different types of tools and technologies. (especially in data-science related architecture).
Is fluent in either Python and wouldn't be intimidated by having to write a small library to do a Neo4j integration.
Responsibilities:
Help the data science and related-communities better understand how, when, and why they should consider graphs. Your approach can be flexible if you find interesting opportunities to do this, but as a guideline, you can expect to:

Write thought compelling content (blog posts, videos, etc.) showcasing graph data science solutions and how to combine Neo4j with other data science tools.
Plan ways to collaborate with other types of technologies, tools, alongside graph to make more powerful solutions in data science.
Work with industry partners / Neo4j users / companies / thought-leaders to help align their graph data science stories with trending topics and push their message to the data science community (advice or sharing opportunities that you discover for awareness).
Present at industry conferences.
The leading Graph Database Neo4j is extending its capabilities in the data science space with additional functionality for graph data science. Data scientists should be enabled to use contextual connected data to make better predictions and improve the accuracy of their models.

The Opportunity
We have a rare opportunity for a Machine Learning Scientist who wants to take the latest advances in ML and NLP to develop this technology for delivery in production.
This is a chance to take your passion for solving complex problems, and apply your findings tactically not just theoretically, as you build out solutions to solve a major industry challenge faced by large global customers. Reporting to our Data Science Lead, you will collaborate with our Machine Learning and Engineering teams to implement best practices and further iterate on our core AI information extraction competency. This is a unique opportunity to get in at the ground level as we scale; to define AI models for our entire organization and to revolutionize an industry with data that’s actionable.
Our Tech Stack:
We deploy on AWS, and we build in Python. But that’s only part of the story. Our Machine Learning team continuously uses their toolkit of expertise to help us make future choices to shape the technology environment and tools we use.
Our new Machine Learning Scientist will:
Develop. In this role, you’ll hit the ground running creating production-level code for our core AI capability within your first month.

Whether you find this information on Reddit, StackExchange, HackerNews, or in academic journals is up to you, but you’ll be expected to share key takeaways with us.
Collaborate. You will work with our Research and Engineering teams to iterate, develop and mature best in market product solutions.
Our new Machine Learning Scientist has:
The experience. You have 2+ years of experience developing production-level code, preferably in a machine learning or SaaS software environment. You have a strong understanding of machine learning development in Python and have an understanding of information extraction problems and related areas in ML.
The education. Ideally, you hold a master’s degree or Ph.D. in machine learning, computer science, physics, mathematics, statistics, or a related analytical field. We do, however, recognize that not everyone gains their skills this way. If you have a bachelor’s degree in software engineering or computer science and the technical work experience to match, we’d still like to see your profile.
The technical skillset. You have a deep knowledge of Python ML tools, including sci-kit-learn, and Pandas or similar frameworks. You’ve successfully applied these technologies in the past and are eager to learn new ways to leverage these frameworks.
