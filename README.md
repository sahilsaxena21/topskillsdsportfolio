# Characterizing Industry Needs in Data Science

## Executive Summary

Data Science is a broad discipline encompassing a wide range of tools, languages , technologies and frameworks. Aspiring data scientists in Canada looking to upskill may want to ensure that the skills they are practicing actually align with current industry needs. If this process is not programmatic , the user would have to read through the job descriptions manually, while keeping a record of the skills enlisted in each one, which takes time and effort. Moreover, data science is an evolving field, and hence this process would need to be repeated every so often to stay current.

The app attempts to allivieate this problem by taking an **programamtic** approach. Hundreds of job postings are scraped from Indeed.ca. The in-demand hard-skills are also scraped from well-maintained webpages such as O'Reilly's Data Science Glossary, Google's Machine Learning Glossary and more. Both datasets are processed and cross-referenced for insights, thereby mitigating need for manual reading of job postings.
